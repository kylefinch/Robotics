Our objective:
	The objective of this exercise was to be able to identify a "tag" object
	(in this case, a colored orange-blue-orange strip of paper) with an
	ARDrone, fly towards it, and land within 5 feet of the strip.

Our approach:
	On a high level, our approach was to have the drone lift off and rotate in
	a circle until the tag was identified. Once the tag was identified, the
	drone would fly forward until it either became in range of the tag (in
	which case the drone would land), or the tag went out of the acceptable
	box that the drone was trying to keep it in (think of centering the camera
	on the tag). If that was the case, then the drone would re-center the tag
	(within an acceptable range) before moving forward again.

What we could have done differently:
	By far the biggest problem was that drones drift no matter what. This means
	that the longer the drone stayed in the air (no matter how much it moved),
	the more likely it would run into something. For us, the biggest issue was
	that the drone would drift heavily when we were searching for the tag. If
	we could have done something differently, we would have used the drone's
	bottom camera along with a tag on the ground to make sure that it did not
	drift while searching for the goal tag.

Extra credit:
	The only thing that could be considered extra credit was the fact that our
	drone started off in different rotations. Our drone started in roughly the
	same location every time, but the direction it was facing was different.
